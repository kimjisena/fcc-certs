# freeCodeCamp Certification Projects
Hello there!

I've been hobby-coding for a while. I think it's time I acquired some certification.

I'll be using this repo to host my code for all FCC certification projects.

### 1. Survey Form

In this project, I built a survey form intended to collect 'bookishness' information.

### 2. Tribute Page

In this project, I built a tribute page to Dennis M. Ritchie of C & Unix fame. As a 
passionate tech savy geek, I've grown looking up to giants of the likeness of `dmr`. I'm 
forever grateful for the work they (`dmr` et al.) did at Bell Labs.
