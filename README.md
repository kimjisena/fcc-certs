# freeCodeCamp Certification Projects
Hello there!

I've been hobby-coding for a while. I think it's time I acquired some certification.

I'll be using this repo to host my code for all FCC certification projects.

## Responsive Web Design Certification Projects

### 2. Tribute Page

In this project, I built a tribute page to Dennis M. Ritchie of C & Unix fame. As a 
passionate tech savy geek, I've grown looking up to giants of the likeness of `dmr`. I'm 
forever grateful for the work they (`dmr` et al.) did at Bell Labs.

### 3. Technical Documentaion

In this project, I built a technical documentation page based on Rob Pike's _Notes on Programming 
in C_ essay. Rob Pike is one of the giants on whose shoulders I'm standing.

Well, I literally just copied the essay with very little modification.
