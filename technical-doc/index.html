                    Kernighan and Plauger's <i>The Elements of Programming Style</i> was an important and rightly
                    influential book. But sometimes I feel its concise rules were taken as a cookbook approach to good style
                    instead of the succinct expression of a philosophy they were meant to be. If the book claims that variable
                    names should be chosen meaningfully, doesn't it then follow that variables whose names are small essays
                    on their use are even better? Isn't <code>MaximumValueUntilOverflow</code> a better name than <code>maxval</code>? I
                    don't think so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What follows is a set of short essays that collectively encourage a philosophy of clarity in program-
                    ming rather than giving hard rules. I don't expect you to agree with all of them, because they are opinion
                    and opinions change with the times. But they've been accumulating in my head, if not on paper until now,
                    for a long time, and are based on a lot of experience, so I hope they help you understand how to plan the
                    details of a program. (I've yet to see a good essay on how to plan the whole thing, but then that's partly
                    what this course is about.) If you find them idiosyncratic, fine; if you disagree with them, fine; but if they
                    make you think about why you disagree, that's better. Under no circumstances should you program the
                    way I say to because I say to; program the way you think expresses best what you're trying to accomplish
                    in the program. And do so consistently and ruthlessly.

                    A program is a sort of publication. It's meant to be read by the programmer, another programmer
                    (perhaps yourself a few days, weeks or years later), and lastly a machine. The machine doesn't care how
                    pretty the program is — if the program compiles, the machine's happy — but people do, and they should.
                    Sometimes they care too much: pretty printers mechanically produce pretty output that accentuates
                    irrelevant detail in the program, which is <b>as</b> sensible <b>as</b> putting all the prepositions <b>in</b> English text <b>in</b> bold
                    font. Although many people think programs should look like the Algol-68 report (and some systems even
                    require you to edit programs in that style), a clear program is not made any clearer by such presentation,
                    and a bad program is only made laughable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Typographic conventions consistently held are important to clear presentation, of course — indenta-
                    tion is probably the best known and most useful example — but when the ink obscures the intent, typogra-
                    phy has taken over. So even if you stick with plain old typewriter-like output, be conscious of typographic
                    silliness. Avoid decoration; for instance, keep comments brief and banner-free. Say what you want to say
                    in the program, neatly and consistently. Then move on.

                <p>
                    Ah, variable names. Length is not a virtue in a name; clarity of expression <i>is</i>. A global variable
                    rarely used may deserve a long name, <code>maxphysaddr</code> say. An array index used on every line of a loop
                    needn't be named any more elaborately than <code>i</code>. Saying <code>index</code> or <code>elementnumber</code> is more to type (or
                    calls upon your text editor) and obscures the details of the computation. When the variable names are
                    huge, it's harder to see what's going on. This is partly a typographic issue; consider
                </p>
                <p class="indent">
                    <code>for(i=0 to 100)</code> <br /> <code class="indent-further">array[i]=0</code>
                </p>
                <p><i>vs</i></p>
                <p class="indent">
                    <code>for(elementnumber=0 to 100)</code> <br /> <code class="indent-further">array[elementnumber]=0;</code>
                </p>
                <p>The problem gets worse fast with real examples. Indices are just notation, so treat them as such.</p>
                <p>
                    Pointers also require sensible notation. <code>np</code> is just as mnemonic as <code>nodepointer</code> if you con-
                    sistently use a naming convention from which <code>np</code> means "node pointer" is easily derived. More on this in
                    the next essay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As in all other aspects of readable programming, consistency is important in naming. If you call one
                    variable <code>maxphysaddr</code>, don't call its cousin <code>lowestaddress</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, I prefer minimum-length but maximum-information names, and then let the context fill in the
                    rest. Globals, for instance, typically have little context when they are used, so their names need to be rela-
                    tively evocative. Thus I say <code>maxphysaddr</code> (not <code>MaximumPhysicalAddress</code>) for a global variable,
                    but <code>np</code> not <code>NodePointer</code> for a pointer locally defined and used. This is largely a matter of taste, but
                    taste is relevant to clarity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I eschew embedded capital letters in names; to my prose-oriented eyes, they are too awkward to read
                    comfortably. They jangle like bad typography.

                <p>
                    C is unusual in that it allows pointers to point to anything. Pointers are sharp tools, and like any such
                    tool, used well they can be delightfully productive, but used badly they can do great damage (I sunk a
                    wood chisel into my thumb a few days before writing this). Pointers have a bad reputation in academia,
                    because they are considered too dangerous, dirty somehow. But I think they are powerful <i>notation</i>, which
                    means they can help us express ourselves clearly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider: When you have a pointer to an object, it is a name for exactly that object and no other.
                    That sounds trivial, but look at the following two expressions:
                </p>
                <p class="indent">
                    <code>np</code> <br />
                    <code>node[i]</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first points to a node, the second evaluates to (say) the same node. But the second form is an expres-
                    sion; it is not so simple. To interpret it, we must know what <code>node</code> is, what <code>i</code> is, and that <code>i</code>  and <code>node</code> are
                    related by the (probably unspecified) rules of the surrounding program. Nothing about the expression in
                    isolation can show that <code>i</code> is a valid index of <code>node</code>, let alone the index of the element we want. If <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>
                    and <code>k</code> are all indices into the <code>node</code> array, it's very easy to slip up, and the compiler cannot help. It's partic-
                    ularly easy to make mistakes when passing things to subroutines: a pointer is a single thing; an array and an
                    index must be believed to belong together in the receiving subroutine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An expression that evaluates to an object is inherently more subtle and error-prone than the address
                    of that object. Correct use of pointers can simplify code:
                </p>
                <p class="indent"><code>parent->link[i].type</code></p>
                <p><i>vs</i></p>
                <p class="indent"><code>lp->type.</code></p>
                <p>If we want the next element's type, it's</p>
                <p class="indent"><code>parent->link[++i].type</code></p>
                <p>or</p>
                <p class="indent"><code>(++lp)->type.</code></p>
                <p>
                    <code>i</code> advances but the rest of the expression must stay constant; with pointers, there's only one thing to
                    advance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Typographic considerations enter here, too. Stepping through structures using pointers can be much
                    easier to read than with expressions: less ink is needed and less effort is expended by the compiler and
                    computer. A related issue is that the type of the pointer affects how it can be used correctly, which allows
                    some helpful compile-time error checking that array indices cannot share. Also, if the objects are struc-
                    tures, their tag fields are reminders of their type, so
                </p>
                <p class="indent"><code class="indent-further">np->left</code></p>
                <p>
                    is sufficiently evocative; if an array is being indexed the array will have some well-chosen name and the
                    expression will end up longer:
                </p>
                <p class="indent"><code class="indent-further">node[i].left.</code></p>
                <p>Again, the extra characters become more irritating as the examples become larger.</p>
                <p>
                    As a rule, if you find code containing many similar, complex expressions that evaluate to elements of
                    a data structure, judicious use of pointers can clear things up. Consider what
                </p>
                <p class="indent">
                    <code>if(goleft)</code> <br />
                    <code class="indent-further">p->left=p->right->left;</code> <br />
                    <code>else</code> <br />
                    <code class="indent-further">p->right=p->left->right;</code>
                </p>
                <p>would look like using a compound expression for p. Sometimes it's worth a temporary variable (here <code>p</code>) or
                    a macro to distill the calculation.</p>
                <code></code>
                <ul>

                <p>
                    Procedure names should reflect what they do; function names should reflect what they <i>return</i>. 
                    Functions are used in expressions, often in things like <code>if</code>'s, so they need to read appropriately.

                <p class="indent"><code>if(checksize(x))</code></p>

                <p class="indent"><code>if(validsize(x))</code></p>

                <p>
                    A delicate matter, requiring taste and judgement. I tend to err on the side of eliminating comments,
                    for several reasons. First, if the code is clear, and uses good type names and variable names, it should
                    explain itself. Second, comments aren't checked by the compiler, so there is no guarantee they’re right,
                    especially after the code is modified. A misleading comment can be very confusing. Third, the issue of
                    typography: comments clutter code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I do comment sometimes. Almost exclusively, I use them as an introduction to what follows.
                    Examples: explaining the use of global variables and types (the one thing I always comment in large pro-
                    grams); as an introduction to an unusual or critical procedure; or to mark off sections of a large computa-
                    tion.
                </p>
                <p>There is a famously bad comment style:</p>
                <p class="indent"><code>i=i+1;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* Add one to i */</code></p>
                <p>and there are worse ways to do it:</p>
                <p class="indent">
                    <code>/**********************************</code><br />
                    <code>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</code><br />
                    <code>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add one to i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</code> <br />
                    <code>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</code><br />
                    <code>**********************************/</code> <br />
                    <code class="indent-further">i=i+1;</code>
                </p>
                <p>Don't laugh now, wait until you see it in real life.</p>
                <p>
                    Avoid cute typography in comments, avoid big blocks of comments except perhaps before vital sec-
                    tions like the declaration of the central data structure (comments on data are usually much more helpful
                    than on algorithms); basically, avoid comments. If your code needs a comment to be understood, it would
                    be better to rewrite it so it's easier to understand. Which brings us to

                    Most programs are too complicated — that is, more complex than they need to be to solve their problems efficiently. 
                    Why? Mostly it's because of bad design, but I will skip that issue here because it's a big
                    one. But programs are often complicated at the microscopic level, and that is something I can address here.

                        You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time. Bottlenecks occur in surprising
                        places, so don't try to second guess and put in a speed hack until you've proven that's where the bottleneck
                        is.

                        Fancy algorithms are slow when <i>n</i> is small, and <i>n</i> is usually small. Fancy algorithms have
                        big constants. Until you know that <i>n</i> is frequently going to be big, don't get fancy. (Even if <i>n</i> does get
                        big, use Rule 2 first.) For example, binary trees are always faster than splay trees for workaday problems.

                        Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, and they're much harder to implement. Use
                        simple algorithms as well as simple data structures.
                        <p>The following data structures are a complete list for almost all practical programs:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>array</li>
                            <li>linked list</li>
                            <li>hash table</li>
                            <li>binary tree</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Of course, you must also be prepared to collect these into compound data structures. For instance, a sym-
                            bol table might be implemented as a hash table containing linked lists of arrays of characters.

                        Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the
                        algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.

                <p>
                    Algorithms, or details of algorithms, can often be encoded compactly, efficiently and expressively as
                    data rather than, say, as lots of <code>if</code> statements. The reason is that the <i>complexity</i> of the job at hand, if it is
                    due to a combination of independent details, <i>can be encoded</i>. A classic example of this is parsing tables,
                    which encode the grammar of a programming language in a form interpretable by a fixed, fairly simple
                    piece of code. Finite state machines are particularly amenable to this form of attack, but almost any pro-
                    gram that involves the 'parsing' of some abstract sort of input into a sequence of some independent
                    'actions' can be constructed profitably as a data-driven algorithm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this kind of design is that the tables can sometimes be generated 
                    by another program — a parser generator, in the classical case. As a more earthy example, if an 
                    operating system is driven by a set of tables that connect I/O requests to the appropriate device drivers, the
                    system may be 'configured' by a program that reads a description of the particular devices connected to the
                    machine in question and prints the corresponding tables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the reasons data-driven programs are not common, at least among beginners, is the tyranny of
                    Pascal. Pascal, like its creator, believes firmly in the separation of code and data. It therefore (at least in its
                    original form) has no ability to create initialized data. This flies in the face of the theories of Turing and
                    von Neumann, which define the basic principles of the stored-program computer. Code and data <i>are</i> the
                    same, or at least they can be. How else can you explain how a compiler works? (Functional languages
                    have a similar problem with I/O.)

                <p>
                    Another result of the tyranny of Pascal is that beginners don't use function pointers. (You can't have
                    function-valued variables in Pascal.) Using function pointers to encode complexity has some interesting
                    properties.
                </p>
                <p>Some of the complexity is passed to the routine pointed to. The routine must obey some standard
                    protocol — it's one of a set of routines invoked identically — but beyond that, what it does is its business
                    alone. The complexity is <i>distributed</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is this idea of a protocol, in that all functions used similarly must behave similarly. This
                    makes for easy documentation, testing, growth and even making the program run distributed over a net-
                    work — the protocol can be encoded as remote procedure calls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I argue that clear use of function pointers is the heart of object-oriented programming. Given a set of
                    operations you want to perform on data, and a set of data types you want to respond to those operations, the
                    easiest way to put the program together is with a group of function pointers for each type. This, in a 
                    nutshell, defines class and method. The O-O languages give you more of course — prettier syntax, derived
                    types and so on — but conceptually they provide little extra.
                </p>
                <p>Combining data-driven programs with function pointers leads to an astonishingly expressive way of
                    working, a way that, in my experience, has often led to pleasant surprises. Even without a special O-O
                    language, you can get 90% of the benefit for no extra work and be more in control of the result. I cannot
                    recommend an implementation style more highly. All the programs I have organized this way have 
                    survived comfortably after much development — far better than with less disciplined approaches. Maybe
                    that's it: the discipline it forces pays off handsomely in the long run.

                <header>Include Files</header>
                <p>Simple rule: include files should never include include files. If instead they state (in comments or
                    implicitly) what files they need to have included first, the problem of deciding which files to include is
                    pushed to the user (programmer) but in a way that's easy to handle and that, by construction, avoids multi-
                    ple inclusions. Multiple inclusions are a bane of systems programming. It's not rare to have files included
                    five or more times to compile a single C source file. The Unix <code>/usr/include/sys</code> stuff is terrible this
                    way.
                </p>
                <p>There's a little dance involving <code>#ifdef</code>'s that can prevent a file being read twice, but it's usually
                    done wrong in practice — the <code>#ifdef</code>'s are in the file itself, not the file that includes it. The result is
                    often thousands of needless lines of code passing through the lexical analyzer, which is (in good compilers)
                    the most expensive phase.
