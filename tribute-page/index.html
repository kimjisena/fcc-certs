                    <h2>Biography</h2>
                    <p>
                        Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie (born September 9, 1949) was an American 
                        computer scientist. Dennis Ritchie was born in Bronxville, New York to 
                        one Alistair E. Ritchie, a longtime Bell Labs scientist.

                    <p>
                        Dennis Ritchie graduated from Harvard University with degrees in Physics and applied 
                        mathematics. Ritchie began working at the Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center in 1967.

                        In the 1960s, Ritchie and his longtime colleague Ken Thompson worked on the Multics 
                        operating system at Bell Labs. Their experience on the Multics project greatly influenced 
                        the design and development of the Unix operating system later in 1969.

                        After a lifetime of remarkable contributions to the field of computer science and human life 
                        at large, Dennis Ritchie was found dead on October 12, 2011 at the age of 70 at his home in Berkeley 
                        Heights, New Jersey.

                        <h3>The Unix operating system</h3>
                        <p>
                            The first version of the Unix operating system was developed by Ken Thompson. It was 
                            done entirely in assembly and hence was closely tied to the PDP-11 machine for which the 
                            system was first developed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As Unix grew from simply a hobby system and Ken's playground to a serious operating system 
                            for office and scientific work, the question of portability became apparent. 
                            Dennis Ritchie played a major role in porting Unix specifically for his 
                            invention of the C programming language.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After the invention of the C programming language, the Unix operating system was re-written 
                            in C, first in part and later in full. This made it possible to run the system on different 
                            machines for which C compilers were available. In fact, C reduced the portability problem to 
                            a simple case of writing a compiler.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to that, Ritchie did much of the Unix documentation work. He was known among his 
                            Bell Labs colleagues for his eloquent technical writing style and his dry wit.
